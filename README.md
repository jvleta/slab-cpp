# LASTRA (slab)

From original README:

The SLAB model has been developed to simulate the atmospheric
dispersion of denser-than-air releases over flat terrain.  The
model treats continuous, finite duration, and instantaneous
releases from four types of sources: an evaporating pool, an
elevated horizontal jet, a stack or vertical jet, and an
instantaneous volume source.  While the model is designed to treat
denser-than-air releases, it will also simulate cloud dispersion
of neutrally-buoyant releases.  Consequently, a typical SLAB
simulation covers both the near-field dense gas phase and the far-
field passive gas phase.
